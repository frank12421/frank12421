## Hi, I am Frank.

I worked as a baker for 6 years. I am a journalist and presenter - 15 years active. Together with my wife we founded our own company. The past 12 years I marketed CAD software.  
Now I'm going to be a **web developer** - thanks __neuefische__.

...and other things:
* Love to spend time with my family
* Love to work in my small garden and have a tomato farm
* Try to run at least 3 times a week.
* I like to travel, by foot, by bike, by car, by boat or by plane.
